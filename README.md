### Vim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Vim configuration tailored for Python and web development. It features:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced syntax support for Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Custom Key Mappings**: Streamlined navigation and editing with intuitive shortcuts, preventing the use of arrow keys for movement.
- **Plugin Management**: Managed with Vundle, including useful plugins such as:
  - **NERDTree**: A file explorer for easy navigation.
  - **YouCompleteMe**: Intelligent code completion.
  - **Syntastic**: On-the-fly syntax checking.
  - **SimpylFold**: Python folding support.
- **Color Scheme**: Uses the Gruvbox theme for a visually appealing coding experience.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Seamless interaction with the system clipboard.

Feel free to explore, fork, and customize the setup to suit your own workflow!
